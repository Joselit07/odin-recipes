Odin recipes project

This will be the first offical project since starting the Odin Project.
I'll be making a HTML only basic website for food recipes.
the goal of the project is to have the Website consist of a Main index page,
which will have links to a few recipes.
skills demonstated for this project will be- familiarity with github commits,
pushing and updating the code, and familiarity with HTML commands and protocols.
and correctly laying out the page online with working links and img's.
